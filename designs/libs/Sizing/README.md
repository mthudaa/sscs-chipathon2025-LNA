# Sizing

For sizing analog circuits, the $g_m/I_\mathrm{D}$ methodology is widely used. This method allows you to extract key MOSFET parameters and visualize them in a way that helps you make informed decisions about transistor sizing.

A quick start tutorial on the $g_m/I_\mathrm{D}$ methodology can be found in this [slide deck](https://ieeetoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20160226toronto_sscs.pdf) by Boris.

For the `gf180mcuD` process technology, you can find schematic testbenches, data tables, and performance plots using Jupyter notebooks in [Boris Murmann's repo](https://github.com/bmurmann/Book-on-gm-ID-design/tree/main/starter_files_open_source_tools/gf180mcuD).
